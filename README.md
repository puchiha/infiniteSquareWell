This project was built on a Cocoa-based application written in Objective C++ program that builds a dynamic simulation of energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in a three-piece-wise constant potential. The finite potential well has a probability associated with the particle being found outside the box. The probability of finding a particle outside the box, where the energy of the particle is less than the potential energy is non-zero in this quantum situation. This phenomenon is mathematically explained by the timeindependent Schrödinger equation. For the finite potential well the wave function is a piecewise linear function depending on the energy level. For computational purposes, it was necessary to numerically integrate the Schrödinger equation for each energy value to shoot the wave function from left to right. The program offers a graphic interface to the user.
